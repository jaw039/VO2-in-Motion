        At this stage of the project, we have investigated our data and brainstormed ideas that help answer our question: 
        How does VO2 consumption vary across genders at different speeds? 
        For the development of our visualization, we have added a line graph where the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents VO2 level. 
        We have also added filters to the graph, allowing users to explore how VO2 consumption differs across genders and varies with different speeds.
        Additionally, we've implemented a brush feature that shows the average VO2 level over a selected period.
        Furthermore, we've incorporated a legend into our graph, which is useful for users who wish to compare VO2 consumption across genders. 
        We've also added a visualization that includes a boy and a girl running on treadmills, displaying their heart rates at selected speeds.

        Looking ahead, the most challenging part of our project will likely be smoothing out the line graph, as our current lines have too many oscillations. 
        This will require significant data cleaning and possibly returning to Jupyter Notebook to determine what might need to be imputed. 
        This process will involve ensuring that aggregations, such as averages over time for each gender, do not include extreme outliers that could skew these averages.
        Additionally, we must ensure that this approach applies not only to the gender filter but also to the age filter we plan to add.
        The data cleaning process and aggregation will be time-consuming, but we see this as beneficial for providing viewers with a smoother viewing experience and a clearer answer to our question.
        We hope that this will make our line chart easier to understand and interact with.
